 Motivation: 
   Portability refers to the ease with which source code can be moved 
   from machine to machine. A portable program requires little or no 
   change to the source code when compiled and run on a different machine. 
   Portability of numerical code is important for several reasons.
   Fortran 90 introduces several new mechanisms to aid in porting numerical 
   code to other machines. The most difficult problem in porting numerical 
   programs is in the portable selection of precision. Selecting the precision 
   of a computation in a portable way was impossible with Fortran 77. 
   However, with the introduction of kind values as well as intrinsic 
   environmental inquiry functions for selecting and inquiring about 
   precision, Fortran 90 programs should be much easier to port to other machines.
   Kind values are integer constants that can be used to further specify 
   the characteristics of an intrinsic type, such as integer or real. 
   For example, real( 2 ) selects a real type with kind value 2. 
   Unfortunately, kind values are processor-dependent and are therefore 
   not standardized. However, there are several portable ways to 
   select kind values based on the precision desired. Two such functions 
   are selected_int_kind and selected_real_kind
<P>
 Description: 
   Provide named kind parameters for use in declarations of real and integer 
   variables with specific byte sizes (i.e. one, two, four, and eight byte
   integers; four and eight byte reals). The parameters can then be used
   in (KIND = XX) modifiers in declarations.
   A single function (SizesOK()) is provided to ensure that the selected 
   kind parameters are correct.

 Design Notes:
   Fortran 90 doesn't allow one to check the number of bytes in a real variable;
   we check only that four byte and eight byte reals have different kind parameters.

 Description:
 Users may call this function once to ensure that the kind parameters 
 the module defines are available with the current compiler. 
 We can't ensure that the two REAL kinds are actually four and 
 eight bytes long, but we can ensure that they are distinct. 
 Early Fortran 90 compilers would sometimes report incorrect results for 
 the bit_size intrinsic, but I haven't seen this in a long time.
